Isolate the non-deterministic code and test the other parts that do not rely on it.
This can alos allow for testing specifically for the non deterministic code as well

Could try change or mainpualte the code to makle it detemrinistic for testing puroposes
Could allow for multiple output testing, however I am unsure how feasible this may be as an implmeentation
Could ecompass a range of outputs that it checks for.
